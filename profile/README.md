# 🛡️ zkDAO - Decentralized Governance with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Welcome to **zkDAO**, a decentralized autonomous organization framework that leverages **zero-knowledge proofs** (ZKPs) to ensure **privacy-preserving governance** and **anonymous participation** in on-chain voting.

## ⚙️ What is zkDAO?

zkDAO is an open-source protocol designed to bring **transparent yet private** voting mechanisms to DAOs using **ZK-SNARKs**. It enables members to cast votes anonymously while allowing on-chain verification of voting validity and quorum.

### 🔒 Key Features

- ✅ **Zero-Knowledge Voting:** Vote without revealing identity or vote content.
- 🗳️ **On-chain Verification:** Ensure vote integrity and quorum using Merkle proofs.
- 🌐 **Multi-DAO Support:** Manage multiple DAOs with isolated governance and proposals.
- 🔐 **Proposer Proofs:** Only authorized members can submit proposals via signature or ZK-based auth.
- 📦 **Modular Architecture:** Easy to extend, audit, and deploy.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** React + Next.js + Zustand + TailwindCSS
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity-based ZK-enabled Governor
- **ZK Layer:** Circom circuits + SnarkJS or Noir
- **Backend (optional):** Node.js / Express server to assist with Merkle proofs, relayers, etc.
